          <strong>Overview:</strong> This interdisciplinary research project was developed in collaboration with McGill’s Biology Department and fellow engineering students to investigate how surgically repaired bones — specifically those connected with screws — respond to high-frequency vibrations during rocket launches.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Role & Responsibilities:</strong> As part of the hardware division, I worked on PCB design, soldering, and testing. Our system used an IEPE accelerometer and STM32 microcontroller to gather and store acceleration data in an SD card. I also assisted with integrating a Peltier Cooler system to regulate temperature for testing bone stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Technical Tools:</strong> Altium Designer, LTSpice, STM32, IEPE Accelerometer, SD card logging, soldering techniques, and component sourcing from DigiKey.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Design Process:</strong> Focused on multi-layer PCB layout and trace routing, resolving component placement issues and managing signal paths using vias and polygon pours for electrical integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Status:</strong> The first PCB iteration is printed and currently undergoing testing. If successful, final assembly and system integration will follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> This project helped me experience the full design cycle — from schematics to soldering to debugging — and strengthened my ability to collaborate across disciplines, especially with biology and mechanical engineering teammates.
